Here is the current relevant files list:
{% if relevant_files %}{{ relevant_files }}{% else %}[]{% endif %}

Now, with multiple iterations you have to find relevant files for the current task. Here are commands that you can use:
- `read_file` - list of files that you want to read
- `add_file` - add file to the list of relevant files
- `remove_file` - remove file from the list of relevant files
- `finished` - boolean command that you will use when you finish with adding files
