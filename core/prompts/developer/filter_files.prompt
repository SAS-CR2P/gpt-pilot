We're starting work on a new task for a project we're working on.

{% include "partials/project_details.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/files_list.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/relative_paths.prompt" %}

We've broken the development of the project down to these tasks:
```
{% for task in state.tasks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ task.description }}{% if task.get("completed") %} (completed){% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

The next task we need to work on is: {{ current_task.description }}

Before we dive into solving this task, we need to determine which files which files from the above list are relevant to this task. Output the relevant files in a JSON list.
