This also didn't help to solve the issue so we can conclude that you are unable to solve this problem yourself so I got a human here who will help you out.

First, focus on the problem you're facing and explain it to the human. Explain what is the issue that you're working in, specify logs that are indicative of the problem and the logs should be different, how should they be different and how will that solve the problem.


Log that is indicative of the problem:
    - how the logs look right now
    - how the logs should look like

What did you try to solve the problem?
