Create a very modern styled app with the following description:
```
{{ description }}
```

{% include "partials/files_list.prompt" %}

Use material design and nice icons for the design to be appealing and modern. Use the following libraries to make it very modern and slick:
    1.    Shadcn: For the core UI components, providing modern, accessible, and customizable elements. You have already access to all components from this library inside ./src/components/ui folder, so do not modify/code them!
    2.    Use lucide icons (npm install lucide-react)
    3.    Heroicons: For a set of sleek, customizable icons that integrate well with modern designs.
    4.    React Hook Form: For efficient form handling with minimal re-rendering, ensuring a smooth user experience in form-heavy applications.
    5.    Use Tailwind built-in animations to enhance the visual appeal of the app

Choose a flat color palette and make sure that the text is readable and follow design best practices to make the text readable. Also, Implement these design features onto the page - gradient background, frosted glass effects, rounded corner, buttons need to be in the brand colors, and interactive feedback on hover and focus.

IMPORTANT: Text needs to be readable and in positive typography space - this is especially true for modals - they must have a bright background

You must create all code for all pages of this website. If this is a some sort of a dashboard, put the navigation in the sidebar.

**IMPORTANT**
Make sure to implement all functionality (button clicks, form submissions, etc.) and use mock data for all interactions to make the app look and feel real.

{% if user_feedback %}
User who was using the app "{{ state.branch.project.name }}" sent you this feedback:
```
{{ user_feedback }}
```
{% endif %}
