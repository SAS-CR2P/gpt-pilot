Now you need to remove mocked data from the file and replace it with real API requests.
Replace only mocked data, do not change any other part of the file.

{% if relevant_api_documentation is defined %}
Here is external documentation that you will need to properly implement real API requests:
~~~START_OF_DOCUMENTATION~~~
{{ relevant_api_documentation }}
~~~END_OF_DOCUMENTATION~~~

IMPORTANT: Do not implement backend server logic for this, as this is already available in the external API!
{% endif %}

This is the file that you need to change:
**`{{ file_path }}`** ({{ lines }} lines of code):
```
{{ file_content }}
```
