You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling you that you're assigned to work on a new project. You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}" and you need to create a detailed development plan so that developers can start developing the app.

{{ project_details }}

OK, now, you need to create code to have this app fully working but before we go into the coding part, I want you to split the development process of creating this app into smaller tasks so that it is easier to debug and make the app work. Each smaller task of this project has to be a whole that can be reviewed by a developer to make sure we're on a right track to create this app completely. Also, make sure it is not be split into tasks that are too small for no reason.

Each task needs to be related only to the development of this app and nothing else - once the app is fully working, that is it. There shouldn't be a task for researching, deployment, writing documentation, or anything that is not writing the actual code. Think task by task and create the least number of tasks that are relevant for this specific app.

For each task, there must be a way for human developer to check if the task is done or not. Write how should the developer check if the task is done.

Now, based on the app's description,{% if user_stories %} user stories,{% endif %}{% if user_tasks %} user tasks,{% endif %} and the technologies that you need to use, think task by task and create the entire development plan. Start from the project setup and specify each task until the moment when the entire app should be fully working. For each task, write a description and a user-review goal.
