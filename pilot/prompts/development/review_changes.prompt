A developer on your team has been working on this task:

{{ instructions }}

Based on this instructions, the developer has made changes to file `{{ file_name }}`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
{{ old_content }}
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

{% for hunk in hunks %}## Hunk {{ loop.index }}
```diff
{{ hunk }}
```
{% endfor %}

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, decide whether it should be applied or should be ignored (for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for). Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, menton that.

Example output if 3 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied and one of them should be ignored, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "decision": "apply",
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important",
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "decision": "apply",
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "decision": "ignore",
            "reason": "This hunk accidentially deletes important code",
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "decision": "apply",
            "reason": "Explanation why the fourth hunk should be included in the change",
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!
