Ok, now, take your previous message and convert it to actionable items. An item might be a code change or a command run. When you need to change code, make sure that you put the entire content of the file in the value of `content` key even though you will likely copy and paste the most of the previous message.

**IMPORTANT**
When you want to add a comment that tells the user to add the previous implementation at that place, make sure that the comment starts with `[OLD CODE]` and add a description of what old code should be inserted here. For example, `[OLD CODE] Login route`.
