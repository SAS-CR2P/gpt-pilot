You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling you that you're assigned to add new feature to an existing project. You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}" and you need to create a detailed development plan so that developers can start developing the new feature.

Here is a high level description of "{{ name }}":
```
{{ app_summary }}
```

{% if clarifications %}
Here are some additional questions and answers to clarify the apps description:

```

{% endif %}

```
{% for story in user_stories %}

{% endfor %}
```

{% endif %}
