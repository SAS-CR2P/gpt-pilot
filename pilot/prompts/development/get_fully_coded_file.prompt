Here is how the file `{{ file.path }}` looks like right now:
```
{{ file.content }}
```

And is the new implementation for the same file:
```
{{ new_file.content }}
```

Now, implement the new changes into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.

**IMPORTANT**
Make sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.
Under no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment.
