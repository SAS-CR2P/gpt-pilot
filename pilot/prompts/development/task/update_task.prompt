I have something to say about step at index {{ step_index }}:
```
{{ step }}
```

{{ user_input }}

Please update the task list, removing any steps prior to and including index {{ step_index }}, and taking into consideration my comments above.
{% if running_processes -%}
Note that the following processes are already running:

{%- for key, data in running_processes.items() %}

command_id: {{ key }}
command: {{ data[0] }}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- endif -%}
